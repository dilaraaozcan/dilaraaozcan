# 👋 Hi, I'm Dilara Özcan

I am 20 years old and an interdisciplinary student studying **Software Engineering (1st year)** and **Molecular Biology and Genetics (2nd year)** at the same time.  
I focus on Java fundamentals, algorithms, and problem-solving. I am also interested in bioinformatics, artificial intelligence, and data analysis.  
By practicing regularly on GitHub, I aim to continuously improve myself and reinforce what I learn through small console-based projects.  
My goal is to develop projects that combine biology and software, and to apply my knowledge from both fields to real-world problems.
